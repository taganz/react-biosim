**Disclaimer**
This is a hobby project. I used to program many years ago, but not anymore. I'm doing this just for fun and to learn new technologies. Sorry if you find this a bit messy... :-)



## Known bugs 
- Strange behaviour of speed controls on restart
- Add format to added funcionalities: log, save, load, gif generations
- Refresh tabs on simulation restart
- Restart simulation removeCreature error

## To be completed 
- During the simulation
    - Selected creature information in population tab
    - Radiation button to force a extra mutation level 
- Predator-prey model
    - Plant and herbivor continuous simulation
    - Log and graph acumulated biomass and grid water per generation
    - Genus evolution graph
    - Fitness values for continuous simulation
    - Add metabolism parameters to save file
- Log
    - Select log settings
    - Complete the Powerbi app to analyze log
    - Log selected creature
- Other
    - Remove Google Analytics and Clarity tags
    - Remove creatures from save files


## Some additional ideas 
- Adding metabolic cost to brain size will get smaller networks?
- Show brain for a given specie 
- Phyilogenetic tree
- Diversity evolution graph. Number of different species at each generation
