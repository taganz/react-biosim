**Disclaimer**
This is a hobby project. I used to program many years ago, but not anymore. I'm doing this just for fun and to learn new technologies. Sorry if you find this a bit messy... :-)

## To be completed 
- Selected creature information in population tab
- Plant and herbivor continuous simulation
- Log and graph acumulated biomass and grid water per generation
- Genus evolution graph
- Log options 
- Remove Google Analytics and Clarity tags
- Fitness values for continuous simulation
- Remove creatures from save files
- Add metabolism parameters to save file


## Some additional ideas 
- Adding metabolic cost to brain size will get smaller networks?
- Graphs for biomass


## Known bugs 
- Strange behaviour of speed controls on restart
- Add format to added funcionalities: log, save, load, gif generations
- Refresh tabs on simulation restart
- Restart simulation removeCreature error
