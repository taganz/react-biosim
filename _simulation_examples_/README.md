## Simulation examples

In this folder, you can find output files from some simulations.

The text file contains the output from the Save screen.

If you load its content into the Load screen and press Play, the simulation will run from the moment it was loaded.

The images display species screens and statistics at the generation when the simulation was saved.

You can edit the map and restart the simulation to analyze different scenario variations.
